# Scientific Workflow Diagrams

Elixir workflows could help present easy to understand navigations of scientific workflows capable of integrating training, tools, resources, datasets and much more.

There are many existing workflows people have used to visualize and therefore simplify the complicated mesh of processes needed to perform life science experiments. Some [examples](/examples.md) of which can be found here.

This working group attempts to unify various elixir development teams to create a workflow editor that can allow scientists to easily create simple diagrams for complicated workflows and interconnect the many resources elixir collects. 

An example of an early edition that direly needs a re-implementation can be found on [the old Training Portal; TeSS](http://tess-old.elixir-uk.org)
